description: how we put on a wedding.

## Venue
[Ardoch](https://ardoch-scotland.com/) was a dream. Brianne did everything in her power to make things turn out perfectly -- and that is exactly how they turned out. 

## Photographers
[Cro+Kow](https://www.croandkowlove.com) -- what to say? Sylvia and Simon did a fantastic job. I can't imagine hiring anyone else. 

## Catering
[Regis Banqueting](https://www.regisbanqueting.co.uk/) are the exclusive caterers for Ardoch, so making a choice was easy. Better yet, they did a phenomenal job. From customizing the bar options with us, to making american style pies instead of a cake, and much more, Regis was a pleasure to work with.

## Florist
[Flowers by Cherry Blossom](https://www.flowersbycherryblossom.co.uk/) or to us -- Laura, was incredible.

## Music
[The Jiggers](https://www.thejiggers.co.uk/) were both the 3-piece ceilidh band and provided the DJ later on. Their caller was great -- he got a group of mostly Americans to nearly properly ceilidh. 

## Hair and Makeup
[Get it Glam](https://getitglam.co.uk/) did a stunning job. 

## Other Companies
- We used [Carrs Loch Lomond](http://www.carrslochlomond.co.uk/) to provide taxis home to our guests -- with great success.
- After several snafus with his suit at Indochino, Connor got his suit from Men's Wearhouse. 
- We gave out custom luggage tags from [Curry's Leather](https://www.etsy.com/shop/CurrysLeather?ref=l2-shopheader-name) which came out better than we could have wished.
- [Paperless post](https://www.paperlesspost.com/) for our Save the Dates was great -- partially because Paperless post made it very easy to collect addresses to send invitations to later on.
- [Minted](www.minted.com) for the invitations themselves, and later for matching place settings made things very simple. 
- [Squarespace](www.squarespace.com) made desiging our own website very easy -- and that includes setting up forms to recieve RSVPs in.
